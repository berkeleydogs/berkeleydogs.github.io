      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Berkeley Dogs is a grassroots initiative advocating for the design and funding of inclusive, accessible, and thoughtfully planned dog parks throughout our city. These aren’t just amenities — they’re essential infrastructure that support public health, community connection, and disability access.
