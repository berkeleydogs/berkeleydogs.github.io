            <h3>Why Berkeley Needs More Dog Parks: Our 10-Point Argument</h3>
            <div class="grid-2-cols">
                <div class="argument-item">
                    <h4>1. Promotes Responsible Pet Ownership</h4>
                    <p>Designated dog parks provide a safe, legal, and appropriate space for off-leash exercise, encouraging compliance with leash laws in other public areas and reducing conflicts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="argument-item">
                    <h4>2. Enhances Canine Health and Well-being</h4>
                    <p>Regular off-leash exercise is crucial for a dog's physical health, mental stimulation, and reducing behavioral issues like excessive barking or destructiveness at home.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="argument-item">
                    <h4>3. Fosters Dog Socialization</h4>
                    <p>Dog parks allow dogs to interact with other canines, improving their social skills, reducing fear or aggression, and creating better-behaved community members.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="argument-item">
                    <h4>4. Builds Community and Human Connection</h4>
                    <p>Dog parks serve as natural meeting places, fostering social interaction among residents, building neighborhood cohesion, and creating a sense of shared responsibility for public spaces.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="argument-item">
                    <h4>5. Increases Public Safety</h4>
                    <p>By providing dedicated off-leash areas, dog parks reduce unauthorized off-leash activity in sensitive areas (like children's playgrounds or wildlife habitats), minimizing potential conflicts and promoting a safer environment for all park users.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="argument-item">
                    <h4>6. Reduces Strain on Animal Services</h4>
                    <p>Well-socialized and exercised dogs are less likely to be surrendered to shelters due to behavioral problems, potentially reducing the workload and costs for Berkeley Animal Care Services.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="argument-item">
                    <h4>7. Supports Economic Activity</h4>
                    <p>Dog parks can increase foot traffic to nearby businesses (e.g., coffee shops, pet stores) and enhance the appeal of neighborhoods for residents, including those considering renting or buying property.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="argument-item">
                    <h4>8. Leverages Underutilized Green Spaces</h4>
                    <p>Identifies and repurposes underutilized public land or sections of existing parks that are suitable for conversion into well-maintained dog parks, enhancing their utility for the community.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="argument-item">
                    <h4>9. Aligns with Berkeley's Progressive Values</h4>
                    <p>As a city that champions progressive urban planning and community well-being, providing dedicated spaces for pets and their owners aligns with Berkeley's commitment to diverse recreational opportunities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="argument-item">
                    <h4>10. Addresses a Demonstrated Community Need</h4>
                    <p>The large number of dog owners in Berkeley, coupled with existing challenges around off-leash enforcement in non-designated areas, highlights a clear and present demand for more regulated and enjoyable dog park facilities.</p>

            <h3>Proposed Locations</h3>
            <p>We are actively researching and evaluating potential sites throughout Berkeley that could host new dog parks. Our criteria include accessibility, existing infrastructure, minimal impact on other park users, and equitable distribution across the city.</p>
            <div class="location-item">
                <h4>Potential Site 1: [Placeholder Park Name/Area]</h4>
                <p><strong>Neighborhood:</strong> [e.g., West Berkeley]</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A currently underutilized open space with good sun exposure and potential for easy fencing. Close to residential areas and public transport.</p>

                <h4>Potential Site 2: [Placeholder Park Name/Area]</h4>
                <p><strong>Neighborhood:</strong> [e.g., South Berkeley]</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A flat, grassy area within an existing larger park that could be easily sectioned off without disturbing other recreational activities. Offers existing water access.</p>
